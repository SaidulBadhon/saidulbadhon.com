        Hi, I'm a Full Stack Web & App Developer with 4 years of experience. I
        have worked with multiple technologies to build websites, web
        applications, and native applications. I've completed many projects with
        100% client satisfaction. For me as a professional developer, learning
        new technologies in web and mobile is my passion. I have worked with
        PHP, Python, Java, C# and now in React JS, React Native & Node JS. Right
        now, I am working as a MERN stack engineer on a different platform.
        {/* Armed with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I embarked on a self-directed journey into full-stack web development. Over the course of nine years, my expertise has grown to encompass a diverse range of technologies, including PHP, Python, Java, and C#. Specializing in React JS, React Native, and Node JS, I have honed my skills as a MERN stack engineer.
     My passion for both Web3 and Web2 technologies is evident in my self-guided exploration and mastery of blockchain integration into my core stack. Through relentless self-learning, I have cultivated the ability to seamlessly blend traditional and decentralized approaches, resulting in the creation of robust, user-centric web solutions. */}

      {/* <p className="mb-3">
        Staying at the forefront of industry trends, my commitment to innovation
        remains unwavering. My journey, marked by self-driven learning and
        hands-on experience, underscores my dedication to delivering
        cutting-edge solutions that meet the evolving demands of the
        ever-changing landscape of web development.
